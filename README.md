# Shumin's Fun Fun Zone

Welcome to my digital playground! I'm a software engineer passionate about building intelligent agentic AI applications that push the boundaries of what's possible.

## 🔥 What's Inside?

Dive into a collection of insights, experiments, and stories from my journey in AI engineering:

- **CrewAI Adventures** – Real-world implementations and patterns for multi-agent orchestration
- **Python Chronicles** – Tales of elegant solutions, lessons learned, and code craftsmanship
- **AI Reflections** – Thoughts on LLM capabilities, limitations, and the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of AstroPaper, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
|   ├── pagefind/ # auto-generated when build
│   └── favicon.svg
│   └── astropaper-og.jpg
│   └── favicon.svg
│   └── toggle-theme.js
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── icons/
│   │   └── images/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── blog/
│   │       └── some-blog-posts.md
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
│   └── styles/
│   └── utils/
│   └── config.ts
│   └── constants.ts
│   └── content.config.ts
└── astro.config.ts
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/data/blog` directory.
